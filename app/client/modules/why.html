  <div class="organic-card why-body reveal">
    <p>Every transcription app I tried had the same problems: bloated features I didn't need, "free" tiers designed to frustrate me, and expensive monthly subscriptions — all for something that ran on my own hardware using open-source models.</p>
    <p>I wanted to keep <strong>full control of my words</strong>, my work, and my tools. Something minimal. Hidden when I didn't need it. There when I did.</p>
    <p>oto is built to work quietly, silently, and effortlessly. Speak your thoughts at the speed they come to you. <strong>Capture ideas before your fingers slow them down.</strong> Then refine them on your own terms.</p>

    <p>oto is always lowercase because it isn't the headliner. You are. <strong>Your voice is what matters.</strong></p>
    <p>No cloud. No subscriptions. No bloat. Pay once, keep it forever. Just your voice, your Mac, and the words you choose.</p>
